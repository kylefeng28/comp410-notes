* Know O(n) sorting algorithms?

* Know these ones:
** bucket sort
** radix sort
** quicksort
** heapsort 7.5
** mergesort 7.6

TODO include table of runtimes
TODO transclude?

Questions:

* What is the difference between bucket, radix, and counting sorts?
* What is NBP? 
* Why is `bulidHeap` in linear time even though it uses a for loop with `percolateDown` inside?

* Read Chapters:
** 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3.1-3
** 7.5 (heapsort)
* Practice problems:
** 7.44 and 7.45 are straight-forward; 7.42 and 7.43 less so.
** 6.2 a, 6.3, 6.8, and 6.16
