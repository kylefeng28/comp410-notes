- Know O(n) sorting algorithms?
  - bucket sort
  - radix sort
  - quicksort
  - heapsort 7.5
  - mergesort 7.6

- ADTs:
  - Heaps
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Trees

TODO include table of runtimes

TODO include ADT runtimes. Sorted, unsorted, etc.

Questions:

* What is the difference between bucket, radix, and counting sorts?
* What is NBP? 
* Why is `buildHeap` in linear time even though it uses a for loop with `percolateDown` inside?
* When you build a heap for heapsort, why do you start from the middle of the array? Does it make a difference?

* Read Chapters:
** 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3.1-3
** 7.5 (heapsort)
* Practice problems:
** 7.44 and 7.45 are straight-forward; 7.42 and 7.43 less so.
** 6.2 a, 6.3, 6.8, and 6.16

```java
public static void main() {
	System.out.println("Test");
