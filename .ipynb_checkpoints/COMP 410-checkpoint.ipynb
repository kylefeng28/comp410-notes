    "## 2017-03-27 Hash Tables\n",
    "- Table or array of a fixed `tableSize`\n",
    "- A `hash function` determines where in the table each item should be stored\n",
    "- `2174 % 10 == 4`\n",
    "- `hash(item) % tableSize`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design questions\n",
    "- Choosing a table size\n",
    "- Choosing a hash function\n",
    "- What to do when a collision occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "### `tableSize`\n",
    "- Should depend on the (maximum) number of values to be stored\n",
    "- Load factor: $\\lambda$ = [num items stored]/[tableSize]\n",
    "- Should be prime\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Hash function\n",
    "- If the objects to be stored have integer keys (eg student IDs), then `hash(k) = k` is generally OK, unless the keys have \"patterns\"\n",
    "- Otherwise, some \"randomized\" way to obtain an integer\n",
    "  - Not true randomness as required in cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision resolution\n",
    "- Chaining (closed addressing)\n",
    "- Probing (open addressing)\n",
    "  - Linear probing\n",
    "  - Quadratic probing\n",
    "  - Double hashing\n",
    "  - Perfect hashing\n",
    "  - Cuckoo hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision resolution -- chaining\n",
    "- The hash table is an array of linked lists\n",
    "- Maintain a linked list at each cell/bucket\n",
    "- Insert: at front of list\n",
    "  - Faster if nothing is already in the list\n",
    "- Find and remove\n",
    "- Worst case: $O(n)$\n",
    "- Average case: $O(\\lambda)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision resolution -- linear probing\n",
    "- ????\n",
    "- TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision resolution -- quadratic probing\n",
    "- Clustering problem\n",
    "- Two causes of clustering:\n",
    "  - Multiple keys hash on to the same **location** (secondary clustering)\n",
    "  - Multiple keys hash on to the same **cluster** (primary clustering)\n",
    "- Quadratic probing solves primary clustering\n",
    "- Efficient implementation of $i^2 -> (i+1)^2$ : $(i+1)$ and $(2i+1)$ in parallel, then add $i^2$ and $2i+1$\n",
    "- Choosing `tableSize`:\n",
    "  - Prime: at least half the table gets probe\n",
    "  - Prime of the form $4k+3$ and probe sequence is $\\pm{i^2}$: entire table gets probed\n",
    "- Remove: lazy deletion must be used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision resolution -- double hashing\n",
    "- Solves secondary hashing\n",
    "- Use two hash functions $hash_1$ and $hash_2$\n",
    "- Probe sequence \"step\" size is $hash_2$\n",
    "- $hash_2$ must never evaluate to zero!\n",
    "- $R - (x \\mod R)$, for $R$ a prime smaller than `tableSize`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision resolution -- cuckoo hashing\n",
    "- Goal: constant time $O(1)$ find in the worst case\n",
    "- Remove also takes constant time\n",
    "- Insert has worst-case $\\Theta(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evict (bump) the old value and move it to the other table\n",
    "  - If there is another collision, then keep evicting the old value\n",
    "- Each table should be more than half empty\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rehashing\n",
    "- When load factor becomes too large:\n",
    "  - Approximately double `tableSize`\n",
    "  - Scan old table, inserting each non-deleted item into the new table\n",
    "- Worst case: $O(N^2)$\n",
    "- Average: $O(N)$\n",
    "- Amortized analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Why cuckoo hashing?? TODO\n",
    "In the worst case of all the elements having the same hash, remove and lookup takes $O(1)$."
